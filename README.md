# WpfSampler
A sample WPF application showcasing a variety of useful techniques.

These techniques include: simplified MVVM pattern, behaviors, converters,
Markup extensions, merged dictionaries, custom logging appenders,
and more!

This application doesn't do anything useful, nor is it an example
of how to architect your app. It is simply meant to demonstrate
various techniques I've used when developing WPF applications over
the years that I've found helpful at some point.
